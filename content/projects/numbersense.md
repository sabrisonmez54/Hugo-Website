## Description

Dyscalculia is a common learning difference that makes it hard to do math. In comparison to dyslexia, there is much less awareness that dyscalculia exists, that children can have specific difficulties in the domain of math. When looking at the research literature, for every fourteen research papers on dyslexia, there is only one on dyscalculia. This lack of a solid evidence base has also resulted in a lack of awareness amongst parents, educators, and child psychologists. These two learning disorders often co-occur. Children with dyslexia struggle with math and children with dyscalculia also often struggle with reading. Therefore, given the importance of math, we aim to reevaluate attitudes and to give children who might have math difficulties the attention they deserve.


There is no single presentation of Dyscalculia. Math learning disabilities present differently in different kids. But there are some commonalities:
- Difficulty with addition Difficulty with memorizing multiplication facts
- Slowness or inaccuracy in guessing how many items are in an array (i.e., a pattern of numbers)
- Avoidance of math-based tasks Slowness in arriving at the answers to math problems relative to their peers
- Difficulty with generalizing math facts to unfamiliar problems
- Difficulty noticing patterns
- Difficulty with problem-solving

Our mission is to spread awareness of dyscalculia along with accessibility to resources that help children with Learning disabilities. Using our app, children will improve the visual spatial component that is the root cause of dyscalculia, allowing them to create a sense of key math properties
