## Description

An extensive chat app that mimics a stripped down Slack app. Following a course on Udemy​ and D​evSlopes​ this was the most challenging app I worked on. Users can sign up to the service by creating an account, choosing and avatar, and creating chat rooms, where everyone can talk in real time through a Web-API with connection to a MongoDB instance via mLabs that deployed on Heroku as well as a local hosted API.

## Built With

- Swift
- Xcode
​- REST​
- J​SON
