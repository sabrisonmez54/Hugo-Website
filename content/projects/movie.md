## Description

As my first real Android Studio Project, working with a group of 4, we decided create an app that best displayed all the various skills we picked up in my one month summer course of Android Programming. This is an app that shows the user the latest movies. You can browse movies and check out details about your selected movie.

There are a variety of useful settings: night mode, large text, nickname, and favorite genre. User can add new movies using the fab icon with title and description of a movie of interest. User can add title and description of a movie of interest. User can select settings from dropdown menu. Also user settings persist even when the app is killed.

I authored the R​oom​ D​atabase​ with movie data. Provided direct access to the underlying database implementation using D​AO​ classes. Used C​ardViews​ to display information, as well as ​Swipe​​Gestures​ to delete entries from database, and a ​FAB​ icon to add movies to it.

## Built With

- Android Studio
